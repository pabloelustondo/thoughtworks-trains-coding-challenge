This folder container a GO implemetation of the algorithm shown in Typescript/Node before.
Besides using go, this version has a reasonable test coverage almost 90% and uses the GO testing framework.
Also, I put more attention to handle error conditions and test them.
Also, the main function now does all the work recursivelly without the need to extra steps to deliver
the specific results the original test cases.

Please, read the previous README for more details


I suggest you run this progeam on VSCode. Easy.

If you want to use the command line here we go:


run ===> go run main.go kiwiland.go kiwiland_messages.go kiwiland_errors.og kiwiland_constants.go

test ===> go test
